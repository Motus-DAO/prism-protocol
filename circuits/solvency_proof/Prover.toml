# Prism Protocol - Solvency Proof Inputs
# This file contains the inputs for generating a proof

# Private input: User's actual balance (hidden from verifier)
# Example: User has 500,000 SOL (in lamports: 500,000,000,000,000)
# For simplicity, we use smaller numbers here (500,000 units)
actual_balance = 500000

# Public input: The threshold to prove
# Example: Must have at least 10,000 SOL
threshold = 10000
