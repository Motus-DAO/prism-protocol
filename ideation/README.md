## How to Use These Documents

### For Reference
All these documents contain valuable information about the complete vision. Use them to:
- Understand the full potential of Prism Protocol
- Reference technical specifications
- Pull ideas for future development
- Explain the broader vision to others

### For Post-Hackathon
After the MVP is complete and submitted, these documents become the roadmap for:
- Mainnet development
- Additional features
- Marketing materials
- Investor presentations

### During Hackathon
**DO NOT GET DISTRACTED BY THESE DOCS**

The winning strategy is in `/WINNING_STRATEGY.md` - that's your bible for the next 7 days.

These ideation docs represent the 10x vision. The winning strategy is the 1x we need to ship NOW.

## The Rule

**"Reference when helpful, but never let them derail the MVP."**

- ✅ Check them when you need technical details
- ✅ Use them for documentation inspiration
- ✅ Reference them in your submission (shows vision)
- ❌ Don't try to build everything in them
- ❌ Don't let perfectionism creep in
- ❌ Don't add "just one more feature"

---

## Post-Hackathon TODO

When you have time after submission:
1. Consolidate these into a single master doc
2. Update with lessons learned
3. Create a proper roadmap
4. Archive decisions that didn't make the cut

But for now: **Focus on `/WINNING_STRATEGY.md` only.**
