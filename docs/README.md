# Prism Protocol – Documentation

**Your wallet's invisible shield.** Solana's first privacy SDK.

Like light through a prism refracts into many colors, **one identity refracts into many context-bound personas**. Prism is privacy infrastructure: disposable identities, ZK proofs, and MPC encryption so you can trade, vote, and transact without revealing who you are or what you hold.

- [Main README](../README.md) — Overview, quick start, and stack
- [What the SDK actually does](./TECHNICAL_WHAT_THE_SDK_ACTUALLY_DOES.md) — Honest technical scope
- [Dark pools and Solana](./DARK_POOLS_AND_SOLANA.md) — Why this use case matters on Solana
- [Arcium + ZK flow](./ARCIUM_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_FLOW.md) — Cryptographic flow
- [Demo script](./DEMO_SCRIPT.md) — 3-minute pitch and flow
