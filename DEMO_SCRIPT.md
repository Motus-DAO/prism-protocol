## 0:00 - 0:30 | HOOK (30 seconds)

### Visual
Screen shows alarming statistics appearing one by one:
- "$1 Billion lost to wallet draining in 2025"
- "95% success rate for RPC timing attacks"
- "Solana ID links wallets, destroying privacy"

### Voiceover
*"Solana's identity solutions have a critical problem."*

*"Wallet linking deanonymizes users. RPC timing attacks work 95% of the time. One malicious signature drains your entire portfolio."*

*"We built Prism Protocol to fix this."*

## 2:00 - 2:45 | IMPACT (45 seconds)

### Visual
Split screen showing:

**Left side**: Traditional approach (problems)
- Wallet linking
- Public voting power
- Total wallet drain
- Repeated KYC

**Right side**: Prism solution (benefits)
- Isolated contexts
- Anonymous proofs
- Protected wallets
- One-time verification

Statistics appear:
```
Prism Protocol Impact:
├─ 99% reduction in wallet draining
├─ 100% voting privacy
├─ 95% RPC attack prevention
└─ Zero-knowledge credentials
```

### Voiceover
*"Prism solves Solana's three biggest problems:"*

*"Number one: Privacy. Context-based identities mean your DeFi wallet never reveals your NFT collection."*

*"Number two: Security. Disposable contexts protect against wallet draining. One malicious signature can't take everything."*

*"Number three: Cross-chain identity. Your Solana reputation works on Ethereum without bridging assets or revealing data."*

*"And it's built for developers. Five lines of code to integrate. Pre-built React components. Works with the entire Solana ecosystem."*

## Technical Setup for Recording

### Equipment Needed
- Screen recording software (OBS, Loom, or QuickTime)
- Good microphone (built-in laptop mic is OK)
- Quiet environment
- Rehearsed demos (no live transactions)

### Pre-Recording Checklist
- [ ] All demos working and tested
- [ ] Script memorized or available
- [ ] Recording software configured (1080p, 30fps)
- [ ] Browser tabs prepared
- [ ] Desktop cleaned up (hide personal info)
- [ ] Audio test completed
- [ ] Timing rehearsed (stay under 3:00)

### Recording Process
1. **Take 1**: Full run-through (expect mistakes)
2. **Take 2**: Polish performance
3. **Take 3**: Backup (best of 3)
4. Choose best take
5. Edit (trim silence, add captions)
6. Export as MP4 (H.264, 1080p)

### Editing Checklist
- [ ] Trim dead air at start/end
- [ ] Add captions for accessibility
- [ ] Verify timing <3:00
- [ ] Check audio levels
- [ ] Add logo/branding
- [ ] Export high quality

## Backup 90-Second Version

If 3 minutes is too long, here's a condensed version:

### 0:00 - 0:15 | Hook
*"Wallet draining, RPC timing attacks, and privacy leaks plague Solana. Prism Protocol fixes this with context-based identities and zero-knowledge proofs."*

### 0:15 - 1:00 | Demo (One Feature)
*"Watch: Anonymous DAO voting. Prove you hold enough tokens without revealing exact amount. Vote privately, no whale targeting."*

[Show voting demo only]

### 1:00 - 1:30 | Impact
*"Prism gives users privacy, developers easy integration, and the ecosystem real security. Five-line SDK integration. Works everywhere."*

**Total**: 1:30 ✓

---

## Alternative Opening Hooks

Choose based on audience:

### Technical Audience
*"95% RPC timing attack success rate. That's not a bug, it's a design flaw. Prism Protocol is privacy infrastructure that actually works."*

### Security Focus
*"$1 billion lost to wallet draining in 2025. One signature shouldn't drain your entire portfolio. We built a better way."*

### Privacy Focus
*"Solana ID links all your wallets together. That's the opposite of privacy. Prism creates context-based identities that actually protect you."*

### Developer Focus
*"Building privacy into your Solana dApp shouldn't require a PhD. Prism is five lines of code. Here's how it works."*

---

## Demo Environment Setup

### Test Accounts
- Main wallet: `7Bx9...3kL2` (funded with devnet SOL)
- DeFi context: `9Km2...8pQ4` (created before demo)
- Gaming context: `4Lp7...6rW1` (created before demo)
- Flex context: `1RcH...9kL2` (same as main for demo)

### Demo Data
- Token balance: 50,000 governance tokens (on devnet)
- Voting threshold: 1,000 tokens
- Phishing site: Localhost simulation
- Spending limit: 0.5 SOL

### Prepared Screens
1. Dashboard (home screen)
2. Voting demo (separate tab)
3. Security demo (separate tab)
4. Impact slides (separate tab)
5. Call to action (final slide)

---

## Fallback Plan

If live demo fails:

### Option A: Use Recorded Clips
Have pre-recorded clips of each demo section ready to play

### Option B: Use Static Screenshots
Show static images with voiceover explaining functionality

### Option C: Code Walkthrough
Switch to showing code if UI demos fail:
```typescript
// Show SDK integration
const prism = new PrismProtocol();
await prism.createContext({ type: 'defi' });
const proof = await prism.generateProof({ type: 'age' });
```

---

## Post-Demo Q&A Prep

Likely judge questions:

**Q: "How do you prevent proof forgery?"**
A: "Groth16 proofs verified on-chain. Cryptographically impossible to forge without the private inputs."

**Q: "What's the performance overhead?"**
A: "Proof generation <2 seconds. On-chain verification <100ms. RPC proxy adds <500ms latency."

**Q: "Why not just use Solana Attestation Service?"**
A: "SAS ties credentials to wallets. Prism isolates contexts. We're composable with SAS."

**Q: "How does cross-chain work?"**
A: "Wormhole for attestation transport. ZK proofs verify on target chain. Identity stays on Solana."

**Q: "What about mobile?"**
A: "SDK works in React Native. Mobile wallet integration via Solana Mobile SDK. Post-hackathon priority."

---

## Success Metrics

Demo is successful if judges understand:
1. ✅ Context-based identities separate activity
2. ✅ ZK proofs enable selective disclosure
3. ✅ Wallet drain protection is automatic
4. ✅ Easy developer integration (5 lines)
5. ✅ Works with existing Solana ecosystem

Demo fails if:
- ❌ Technical difficulties prevent showing features
- ❌ Goes over 3:00 time limit
- ❌ Judges confused about core value prop
- ❌ Can't answer basic security questions

---

## Final Checklist

### Day Before Demo
- [ ] Rehearse script 5+ times
- [ ] Test all demos end-to-end
- [ ] Verify devnet transactions working
- [ ] Prepare backup clips
- [ ] Charge laptop fully
- [ ] Test recording software

### Demo Day
- [ ] Join 5 minutes early
- [ ] Test audio/video
- [ ] Share screen correctly
- [ ] Have backup plan ready
- [ ] Deliver with confidence
- [ ] Stay under 3:00
- [ ] Answer questions clearly

---

**Remember**: Judges see 50+ projects. Make yours memorable with:
1. **Clear problem statement** (wallet draining, privacy leaks)
2. **Live demo** (show, don't tell)
3. **Concrete impact** (99% drain prevention, 100% privacy)
4. **Developer-friendly** (5-line integration)

**Good luck! 🚀**
